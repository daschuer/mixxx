fr_CA,fr_CI	Choose between different algorithms to detect beats.
fr_CA,fr_CI	Beat Detection Preferences
fr_CA,fr_CI	When beat detection is enabled, Mixxx detects the beats per minute and beats of your tracks,\nautomatically shows a beat-grid for them, and allows you to synchronize tracks using their beat information.
fr_CA,fr_CI	Enable fast beat detection.\nIf activated Mixxx only analyzes the first minute of a track for beat information.\nThis can speed up beat detection on slower computers but may result in lower quality beatgrids.
fr_CA,fr_CI	Converts beats detected by the analyzer into a fixed-tempo beatgrid.\nUse this setting if your tracks have a constant tempo (e.g. most electronic music).\nOften results in higher quality beatgrids, but will not do well on tracks that have tempo shifts.

If you do not see a mapping for your controller in the "Load Mapping" menu when you click on your controller on the left sidebar, you may be able to download one online from the %1. Place the XML (.xml) and Javascript (.js) file(s) in the "User Mapping Folder" then restart Mixxx. If you download a mapping in a ZIP file, extract the XML and Javascript file(s) from the ZIP file to your "User Mapping Folder" then restart Mixxx.

fr_CA,fr_CI	Controllers are physical devices that send MIDI or HID signals to your computer over a USB connection. These allow you to control Mixxx in a more hands-on way than a keyboard and mouse. Attached controllers that Mixxx recognizes are shown in the "Controllers" section in the sidebar.
fr_CA,fr_CI	You can create your own mapping by using the MIDI Learning Wizard when you select your controller in the sidebar. You can edit mappings by selecting the "Input Mappings" and "Output Mappings" tabs in the preference page for your controller. See the Resources below for more details on making mappings.
